The villagers admired him for his kindness and wisdom. One day, a traveler visited the village and asked the old man about the secret to happiness. The old man smiled and said, "Happiness lies in helping others and appreciating the simple joys of life." The traveler thanked him and left the village with a heart full of gratitude.
